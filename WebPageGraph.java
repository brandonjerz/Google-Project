 * This class should have at least 2 fields: the WebPageParser instance which processed this page; 
 * and the Vertex representing this page in the Graph of pages you must build. You will find sorting your 
 * search results is much easier by having this class implement the Comparable interface and comparing instances 
 * by their page rank. A final suggestion is to use this as the value in your Dictionarys used during and 
 * after "map-reduce".
